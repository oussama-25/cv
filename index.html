    <li>In Spring 2021, <a href="https://www.karen-levy.net">Karen Levy</a> and I taught a new course, <a href="https://courses.cs.cornell.edu/cs1340/2021sp/">Choices and Consequences in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340).</a> The course is designed at
      an introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and will cover a
      range of ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and information.</li>

      <td>Right after I graduated, I started working for C2K: a full service internet agency. I developed a homemade CMS, CRM and e-mail marketing system. The CMS was used for a dozens of clients, as well as the e-mail marketing system. I also did a
        lot of custom made web sites/applications. Later on I also developed Layars like: Conquar (a digital adaption of the board game of Risk) and Gowalla (based on Gowalla's API). C2K no longer exists.</td>

        Silverlight, Ruby on Rails together, to find out which could work best for the company. Based on the results of my research, the company eventually decided to use the ZK Framework.</td>
